Friday, July 31st is a day dedicated to making!

For Global Fab Day, Fab Labs and Regional Networks have the opportunity to create local activities, workshops, presentations, Fab Lab open houses, whatever your community needs and wants, at times that make sense for your part of the world, and we'll advertise it promote it to the global community. We encourage you to get creative, and think about how your community can be empowered and supported at this time.
