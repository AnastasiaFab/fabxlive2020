Friday, July 31st is a day dedicated to making!

For Global Fab Day, Fab Labs and Regional Networks have the opportunity to create local activities, workshops, presentations, Fab Lab open houses, whatever your community needs and wants, at times that make sense for your part of the world. You have the option to share a video conferencing link with other conference attendees or just keep it at the local level. Either way we'll spread the word! We encourage you to get creative, and think about how your community can be empowered and supported at this time.

Apply with your local activity <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNvqFVPSyZ2B18OJ5V1-TXer1_JmsPTVVVr5GGQYPjhFQz1Q/viewform">HERE</a> by Wednesday, July 15!
