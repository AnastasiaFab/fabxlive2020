FABxLive 2020 is an event that tackles the reality of a future happening now under global, economic, social and technological developments due to a Pandemic crisis known as a COVID-19 and how the Fab Lab Network as a global community moved forward and developed solutions that can drive a prospective scenario for the future through the digital fabrication process.


In this special Online/Remote edition of the Fab Event International Conference, we will bring together members of the international Fab Lab Network, as well as government representatives, academic researchers and experts in the field of digital fabrication, to present, envision, discuss, and create a community around digital fabrication, manufacturing, technology, innovation and possible solutions on how to set the best principles and practices on digital fabrication.
