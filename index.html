        FABxLive 2020 is an online event that tackles the reality of a future happening now under global, economic, social and technological
        developments due to a Pandemic crisis known as a COVID-19 and how the Fab Lab Network as a global community moved forward and
        developed solutions that can drive a prospective scenario for our future resilience through distributed manufacturing and solidarity.
        </p>

        <p>
        In this special edition of the Fab Event International Conference, we will bring together members of the international
        Fab Lab Network, as well as government representatives, academic researchers and experts in the field of digital fabrication,
        to present, envision, discuss, and create a community around digital fabrication, manufacturing, technology, innovation and
        possible solutions on how to set the best principles and practices on digital fabrication.
        </p>

        <p>
        The event is open to the community for proposals to self organize sessions that can be debates, talks, webinars around COVID-19
        local community response, rebooting economies, supporting communities, emergent futures and can be targeted to different time zones
        and all languages.

        FABX Events are a way to integrate all the knowledge acquired during the year of over more than 2,000 Fab Labs in the world.
        The participation for content is based on what active members propose. This is a space for networking among speakers, workshop
        leaders, and participants, and what they can make in this new world of digital fabrication. This is a space to brainstorm and
        share your projects, workshops, and ideas, and acknowledge that all the work will be seen and appreciated by everyone.
        Click the link above to apply for a theoretical workshop/working group, workshops and papers. Please note that anything you submit
        must be designed for an online format and online interaction, and you do have the option of pre-recording or leading something Live.
