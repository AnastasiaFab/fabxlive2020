        The FABXLive Online Distributed Conference is a free conference that gives us an opportunity
        to stay connected, reflect and engage deeply around the Fab Lab Network and other community responses
        to COVID-19, the current state of the world and our vision for the future. With more than 2000 Fab Labs in
        126 countries worldwide, we will bring together members of the international Fab Lab Network, government
        representatives, the manufacturing industry, artists, teachers, academic researchers and experts in the
        field of digital fabrication, to present, envision, innovate, create community, and discuss possible
        solutions on how to set the best principles and practices around digital fabrication
        during this unprecedented time in history.
        </p>

        <p>
        July 27-July 30 we will host expert panels, keynote speakers and members of our network.
        On July 31, we will have a GLOBAL FAB DAY, a day dedicated to all of us inventing and imagining locally and together.

            Please keep in mind that, given the circumstances around Covid-19, not everyone will have access to tools you would find in
            a Fab Lab unless they can purchase them ahead of time. Thus we will need a detailed list of materials for ONLINE workshops
            as soon as possible. This is also a chance to rethink what workshops we can do with things you can buy at local stores or
            find in most anyone's home!

        FOREST CNC: Mobile Hand Washing Challenge!
        </p>
        <p>
        We encourage you and your Fab Lab to tackle the challenge of creating a mobile hand washing unit that can be used for populations in need.
        </p>
        <p>
        While the CDC promotes hand washing as the main way to avoid contracting the coronavirus, there are a surprising 
        number of people in the world who do not have access to running water. Among these are Native Americans living in 
        the Navajo Nation in the United States, who represent part of the more than two million North Americans without 
        access to running water in 2020.  The homeless population also has difficulty sourcing water when support services 
        are limited or closed entirely. And many other populations around the world are without access to this basic health-supporting capability.
        </p>
        <p>
         The winner will be announced at FABXLive and will receive a Forest CNC router!
