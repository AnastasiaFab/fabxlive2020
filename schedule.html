  FABxLive: July 27 - July 31, 2020. 
  </p>
  <p>
  July 27 - July 30, we will have a Fab Symposium from 9am - 12pm Eastern Time in the US (UTC -4). During this time, we will start with hearing from panelists and speakers, and per all FABX conference, end the Symposium with Fabercise and Fab World!
  </p>
  <p>
  July 31 will be a Global Fab Day, an opportunity for labs to lead local activities. Since we canâ€™t be together in person for Fab Festival, this is a chance to really get creative in engaging with your local community. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Every day, participants will also have opportunities to speak with sponsors, participate in fab challenges, participate in workshops, and connect on our community platform. We are mindful of the various time differences of all of our participants, and we encourage you to propose a workshop at a time that works for you and your region! We will do our best to make sure everyone can participate.

  A more detailed schedule with links will be coming soon!
