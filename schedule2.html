  Every morning (US EDT) from July 27-July 30 we will host expert panels, keynote speakers and members of our network as they address: 
  Coronavirus response from the Network; Supporting communities; Rebooting economies; Emerging futures. Per all FABX conferences, we will end the Symposiums with Fabercise and Fab World!

  On July 31, we will have a GLOBAL FAB DAY, a day dedicated to all of us inventing and imagining locally and together. Fab labs and their regional networks have the opportunity to create local 
  activities, workshops, presentations, fab lab open houses, whatever your community needs and wants, at times that make sense for your part of the world, and we'll advertise it promote it to the global community.

  Each day of the conference will include Fab World updates as well as a global roster of fantastic, community-led, distributed workshops and discussions in all the time zones of the world.
